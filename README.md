# My Personal Portfolio

Welcome to the repository for my personal portfolio website! This is where I showcase my work, share my thoughts, and connect with others.

## About This Site

This project is built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com), giving me a fast, modern framework with powerful styling capabilities to present my content in the best possible way.

## Local Development

To run this site locally:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

Then visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see it in action.

## What's Inside

- **Portfolio Section** - A collection of my favorite projects
- **Blog** - Where I share my thoughts and experiences
- **About Me** - A little bit about who I am and what I do
- **Contact** - Ways to get in touch with me

## Making Changes

I update this site regularly with new projects and content. I kept this in mind and implemented an index.ts file that allows for easy modification to the website. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Deployment

This site is deployed on [Vercel](https://vercel.com), which makes updates quick and painless. Every push to the main branch automatically updates the live site.
